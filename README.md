# Kanuki's 3DS modding toolbox

This repository is my collection of 3ds modding tools.\
Contains mostly tools made by other people that have been improved/ modified by me. Some tools are made by me.\
I aim to include this repository with useful guides about different modding techniques in the future as well.

Other absolutely essential repositories for 3DS modding:
* [Project_CTR][] 
* [ctr_elf2][]

## Nintendo LZ compression

This is a collection of tools for compressing and decompressing Nintendo's [LZSS][] formats, found in games such as Pok√©mon. MIT licensed.

Supports: (Python 3)

* LZ10 (compression and decompression)
* LZ11 (compression and decompression)
* overlays (decompression only)

Python 2 support is less complete:

* LZ10 (decompression only)
* overlays (decompression only)

magical's Notes: *"Names are pretty inconsistent. I variously refer the compression algorithm as LZSS, LZSS10, LZ10 and NLZ10."*

### Files

* `lzss3.py` - LZ decompression routines for Python 3. Can used as a module or a standalone script.
* `compress.py` - LZ compression routines for Python 3. Should be merged into lzss3.py. Command-line interface is spotty.
* `verify.py` - Script i threw together while trying to debug LZ11 compression. Should be merged into `lzss3.py`. Python 3.
* `lzss.py` - Incomplete LZ decompression routines for Python 2. Only supports LZ10.
* `armdecomp.py` - Command-line tool for decompressing overlays or arm9.bin. Python 2 version.
* `armdecomp3.py` - Command-line tool for decompressing overlays or arm9.bin. Python 3 version. About twice as fast as the Python 2 version. The code has already been merged into `lzss3.py`, so this file isn't really needed.
* `test_lzss3.py` - Tests for `lzss3.py` and `compress.py`.

## DARCTool

This is a tool for extracting and building 3DS darc archive files. In some cases the file extension is ".arc". Remember, if the archive is compressed you must use another tool to handle that.  

Also note that when building archives, it goes by the order returned by readdir(), hence the order in the archive in some cases may not match the original official archive which was extracted previously. Due to this and alignment, the built archive filesize may not match the original official archive filesize either, but this doesn't actually matter.  

The utils.* and types.h files are from ctrtool.

## PSLB Tool

This is a tool for converting PSLB files into human readable json files. PSLB files often show up in games like "Kid Icarus: Uprising" with the extention .json, even though they are not actual json files. \
Command line usage:
`python pslb.py [inputfile] [outputfile]`

[Documentation of the PSLB format][]

## Decrypt Tool

A tool for decrypting 3ds roms. Used for producing .ncch files that contain a game's exheader, exefs and romfs \
Tool made by 54634564. \
Modified to work with python 3 by me (kanuki00). \
Usage: \
`sh setup-venv.sh` to set up a virtual python environment and install pycryptodome \
`source virtual-environment/bin/activate` to activate the environment \
`python decrypt.py Your_Rom.3ds` to decrypt you rom.

## CGFX Tool

Work in progress.

## CTR ELF Tool

NWPlayer123: *"Rewrote* [ctr-elf][] *because it messed up the .bss section and required external dependencies (arm-none-eabi from DevkitARM), only tested with Python 2.7.13 and Yo-kai Watch 3 Sukiyaki but it should work fine on any code.bin+exh.bin"*

*"Also, you can just place it in the directory that ctrtool creates and run it which is a lot easier and faster than making a separate workdir folder."*

*"Not sure what else to put in here, provided with no warranty or guarantee of operability, feel free to modify and redistribute."*
