Nintendo LZ compression
=======================

This is a collection of tools for compressing and decompressing Nintendo's [LZSS][] formats, found in games such as Pok√©mon. MIT licensed.

[LZSS]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Storer%E2%80%93Szymanski

Supports: (Python 3)

* LZ10 (compression and decompression)
* LZ11 (compression and decompression)
* overlays (decompression only)

Python 2 support is less complete:

* LZ10 (decompression only)
* overlays (decompression only)


Note: Names are pretty inconsistent. I variously refer the compression algorithm as LZSS, LZSS10, LZ10 and NLZ10.

Files
-----

* `lzss3.py` - LZ decompression routines for Python 3. Can used as a module or a standalone script.
* `compress.py` - LZ compression routines for Python 3. Should be merged into lzss3.py. Command-line interface is spotty.
* `verify.py` - Script i threw together while trying to debug LZ11 compression. Should be merged into `lzss3.py`. Python 3.
* `lzss.py` - Incomplete LZ decompression routines for Python 2. Only supports LZ10.
* `armdecomp.py` - Command-line tool for decompressing overlays or arm9.bin. Python 2 version.
* `armdecomp3.py` - Command-line tool for decompressing overlays or arm9.bin. Python 3 version. About twice as fast as the Python 2 version. The code has already been merged into `lzss3.py`, so this file isn't really needed.
* `test_lzss3.py` - Tests for `lzss3.py` and `compress.py`.
